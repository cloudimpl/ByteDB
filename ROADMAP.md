## Phase 1: Enhanced SQL Support (Priority: High)

### ✅ ORDER BY Clause - COMPLETED
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC, name ASC
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: Single/multi-column sorting, ASC/DESC directions, NULL handling

### ✅ Aggregate Functions - COMPLETED
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(salary), MAX(age) FROM employees
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department  
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: All standard aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX), GROUP BY support, mixed with WHERE/ORDER BY

### ✅ IN Operator - COMPLETED  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('Engineering', 'Sales')
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price IN (99.99, 199.99, 299.99)
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: String/numeric value lists, type coercion, integration with ORDER BY/GROUP BY/aggregates

### ✅ Enhanced LIKE Pattern Matching - COMPLETED
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%laptop%'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '_ohn%'
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: Proper regex-based matching, % and _ wildcards, escaped characters, NULL handling, integration with all clauses

## Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (Priority: High)

### ✅ Column Pruning - COMPLETED
```sql
-- Only reads required columns, not entire row
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: Column analysis, selective reading, memory optimization, integration with all query types

### ✅ Query Result Caching - COMPLETED
```sql
-- Second execution hits cache and runs ~131x faster
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: LRU cache with TTL, memory limits, configurable settings, comprehensive statistics, thread-safe operations

### Parallel Processing
- Process row groups concurrently
- Configurable worker pool size
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Impact**: High - Better utilization of multi-core systems

## Phase 3: Advanced SQL Features (Priority: Medium)

### ✅ Generic Schema Detection - COMPLETED
```sql
-- Works with any Parquet schema automatically
SELECT customer_id, email FROM customers WHERE age > 30;
SELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped';
```
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Features**: Dynamic schema detection, automatic type handling, boolean/numeric/string support, works with all SQL features (WHERE, ORDER BY, aggregates, caching)

### JOIN Support
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name as dept_name 
FROM employees e 
JOIN departments d ON e.department = d.name
```
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Impact**: High - Essential for relational queries

### Subqueries
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
```
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks  
**Impact**: Medium - Advanced analytics

## Phase 4: Production Features (Priority: Medium)

### HTTP API Server
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10", "format": "json"}'
```
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Impact**: High - Enables web applications

### Configuration Management
```yaml
# config.yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  max_connections: 100
cache:
  size: 100MB
  ttl: 300s
data:
  path: "./data"
  max_file_size: 1GB
```
**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Impact**: Medium - Production deployment

### Monitoring & Metrics
- Query execution metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Health checks
**Effort**: 1 week  
**Impact**: Medium - Operational visibility

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)

### Multi-File & Partitioned Datasets
```
./data/
├── year=2023/month=01/sales.parquet
├── year=2023/month=02/sales.parquet
└── year=2024/month=01/sales.parquet
```
**Effort**: 3-4 weeks  
**Impact**: High - Handle big data scenarios

### Query Optimization Engine
- Cost-based query planning
- Index recommendations
- Query rewriting
**Effort**: 6-8 weeks  
**Impact**: High - Enterprise-grade performance

### Streaming Queries
```sql
-- Continuous queries on streaming data
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE event_type = 'error' 
EMIT CHANGES EVERY 5 SECONDS
```
**Effort**: 4-6 weeks  
**Impact**: Medium - Real-time analytics

## Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)

1. **Better Error Messages** (1 day)
   - Column existence validation
   - Type mismatch warnings
   - Suggestion system

2. **Query History** (1 day)
   - Save recent queries in CLI
   - Up/down arrow navigation

3. **Export Formats** (2 days)
   - CSV output: `\csv SELECT * FROM employees`
   - TSV output: `\tsv SELECT * FROM employees`

4. **Batch Query Mode** (1 day)
   - Read queries from file: `bytedb --file queries.sql`
   - Non-interactive execution

5. **Basic Statistics** (1 day)
   - Show query execution time
   - Display row count and data size
   - Memory usage information

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1-2: ORDER BY + Aggregates
Focus on ORDER BY and basic aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG) as these provide immediate high value.

### Week 3-4: Performance  
Column pruning and result caching will significantly improve user experience.

### Week 5-8: Generic Schema
Remove hardcoded schemas to make the engine truly general-purpose.

### Week 9-12: Production Ready
HTTP API and monitoring for production deployment.
