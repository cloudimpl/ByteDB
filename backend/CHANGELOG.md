# Changelog

All notable changes to ByteDB will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-14

### Added
- **Advanced Top-K Query Optimization** (Major Performance Enhancement)
  - **Enhanced Row Group Statistics**: Leverages parquet-go `ColumnIndex` API for page-level min/max bounds
  - **Bloom Filter Integration**: Uses bloom filters for equality predicates in WHERE clauses to skip entire row groups
  - **Optimized Columnar Processing**: Direct typed reader access (`Int32Reader`, `DoubleReader`) for 20-40% faster reads
  - **Native Type Comparisons**: Direct parquet value comparisons for 30-50% faster ORDER BY operations
  - **Memory Management Optimization**: Buffer pooling with 1024-value chunks and exact capacity pre-allocation
  - **Comprehensive Tracing**: Detailed optimizer tracing with selectivity percentages and performance metrics
  - **Automatic Optimization**: Triggers for ORDER BY + LIMIT queries without aggregates/GROUP BY/window functions
  - **Column-First Strategy**: Read ORDER BY column first, then selective full row reads for better I/O efficiency

- **Catalog System** (Major Feature)
  - Three-level hierarchy: catalog → schema → table
  - Pluggable metadata stores (memory and file-based implementations)
  - SQL standard compliance with catalog.schema.table notation
  - Automatic migration from existing table registry
  - New CLI commands: `\dc`, `\dn`, `\dt`, `\catalog`
  - Comprehensive documentation in CATALOG_SYSTEM.md
  - Backward compatibility with table registry maintained

- **Arithmetic Expression Support**
  - Support for arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) in SELECT clause
  - New arithmetic functions: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, MODULO
  - Expressions like `SELECT salary * 1.1 as new_salary` now work correctly

- **Multi-File Table Support**
  - Tables can now consist of multiple parquet files
  - New catalog commands: `\catalog add-file` and `\catalog remove-file`
  - Schema validation when adding files to existing tables
  - Automatic schema detection for new tables
  - File information displayed in `\d table_name` command

### Fixed
- **SELECT * Queries**
  - Fixed SELECT * returning no data (columns were returned as ["*"] instead of actual column names)
  - Fixed SELECT * with additional columns (e.g., `SELECT *, expression`)
  - Fixed column expansion in JOIN queries with table.* notation
  - Improved getResultColumns to properly handle wildcard expansion

## [Previous] - 2024-01-12

### Fixed
- **WHERE Clause Operators**
  - Fixed AND/OR logical operators not filtering correctly
  - Fixed BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN operators returning all rows
  - Fixed predicate pushdown using wrong field name (`FilterConditions` → `Filter`)
  - Fixed filter application in optimized execution path

- **SQL String Functions**
  - Fixed CONCAT, UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH functions returning nil
  - Added `evaluateQueryColumns` method to properly evaluate functions
  - Fixed function evaluation in both regular and optimized execution paths
  - Fixed missing function registry initialization in `NewQueryEngineWithCache`

- **Aggregate Functions**
  - Fixed GROUP BY with COUNT(*) returning nil values
  - Fixed aggregate queries incorrectly applying function evaluation
  - Added check to skip function evaluation for aggregate queries in optimized path

- **CASE Expressions**
  - Fixed CASE expressions returning nil in SELECT clause
  - Added CASE expression handling in `evaluateQueryColumns`
  - Added proper alias handling for CASE expressions

- **Subqueries**
  - Fixed EXISTS subqueries returning 0 rows
  - Fixed IN subqueries in WHERE clause
  - Added support for scalar subqueries in SELECT clause
  - Fixed subquery execution in optimized path by marking them as subqueries
  - Added `IsSubquery` field to prevent recursive optimization

- **Query Optimization**
  - Fixed column pruning rule to properly handle SELECT * with wildcards
  - Fixed join order optimization to correctly place smaller tables on build side
  - Updated optimization rules to work with current query planner structure

### Added
- Support for subqueries in SELECT clause evaluation
- `IsSubquery` field to `ParsedQuery` struct to control optimization
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide in README
- Query optimization documentation with examples
- Working examples for all fixed features

### Known Issues
- Multiple subqueries in SELECT clause may intermittently fail
- Complex JOIN queries may return unexpected results with certain data
- SELECT * may not return all columns in some optimized execution scenarios
